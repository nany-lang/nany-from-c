* "CXXMemberCallExpr" is not properly implemented (see funcptr.cpp).
* CallExpr with function pointers is sometimes converted with a lambda, which is weird (see glew.c)
+ Handle verbosity properly on all messages
+ Simplify `new std.c.ptr<GLubyte>(null)` into null (see nullcast.c)
  (This works fine when compiling in C++, but not in C)
+ Detect and handle switch..case fallthroughs
